Summary: In this project, I created a query in Microsoft Access that sorts customer data in ascending order. I used the table that includes first names, last names, items purchased, and prices, and I made the query to ascending. After running the query, the results displayed the customers starting with Elizabeth and ending with Javaria since Elizabeth had the lowest price and Javaria had the highest price. This helped me see how sorting works and how Access arranges information based on the field I choose. Doing this activity helped me understand how to use queries to organize data in Access. It taught me how sorting can make large amounts of information easier to read and analyze.

Summary: In this project I learned how to use the outlook calender, I created a weekly class schedule that shows all my courses from Monday to Friday for the fall semester. I organized each class by time and color so I can clearly see when and where everything fits into my week. I added all my courses and I placed them in the correct time slots for each day. I also included an extra event like the pizza party, to show how activities would fit around my classes. Setting it up this way helped me see my busy times, my free hours, and how my days are structured. This project helped me learn how my schedule would work out and it reminds me 15 minutes before class that I have a class on that day at that time.

Summary: In this project I made a flow chart, in my flow chart, I showed the steps of a program I created. First, I started by having the user enter their first name and then input four quiz scores. After that, the program asks for three assessment scores. Once all the scores are entered, the program calculates the quiz average and the assessment average. Then it uses those numbers to find the overall unweighted average and the overall weighted average, with quizzes worth 70% and assessments worth 30%. At the end, the program displays the results and then stops. Working on this project helped me understand how a program goes from one step to another. Creating the chart made me think about the order of inputs, calculations, and outputs, and how each part depends on the one before it or else it will say that there was an error.
